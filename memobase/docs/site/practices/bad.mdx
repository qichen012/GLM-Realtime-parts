## Issue: Too Much Useless Information is Saved

If your user profiles are cluttered with irrelevant data, follow these steps:

1.  **Define Profile Scope**: Start by clearly defining what information each user profile should contain.
2.  **Refine Slot Descriptions**: Provide clear and specific descriptions for each profile slot in your `config.yaml`. This guides the AI on what to extract. [Learn more](/features/profile/profile_desc).
3.  **Enable Strict Mode**: If the issue persists, enable [strict mode](/features/profile/profile_config#strict-mode) to ensure the AI only saves information that directly matches your defined profile slots.

## Issue: Relevant Information is Not Being Saved

If the AI fails to extract important details, try the following:

1.  **Simplify Descriptions**: Your profile descriptions might be too complex for the LLM to interpret. Try simplifying them to be more direct.
2.  **Disable Validation**: If information is still not being captured, you can disable [profile validation](/features/profile/profile_config#profile-validate-mode) to allow for more flexible data extraction.

## Issue: Event is too long/random/not relevant

1. **Use `event_theme_requirement`**: You can add a `event_theme_requirement` to your `config.yaml`, which will be used to generate events:
```yaml
event_theme_requirement: "Focus on the user's infos, not its instructions."
```


## Issue: Profile Data is Inaccurate or Wrong

To improve the accuracy of the information stored in profiles:

1.  **Add Detail to Descriptions**: Enhance your [profile descriptions](/features/profile/profile_desc) with more context and examples to ensure the AI understands the data format and meaning correctly.
2.  **Use Update Instructions**: For each profile slot, add an [update description](/features/profile/profile_desc#instruct-memobase-to-update-a-profile-slot). This tells Memobase how to intelligently merge new information with existing data, which helps maintain accuracy over time.
3. **Use `event_theme_requirement`**: You can add a `event_theme_requirement` to your `config.yaml` to tell Memobase which kind of infos you want to save to profile:
```yaml
event_theme_requirement: "Focus on the user's infos, not its instructions."
```
